# Home-Price-Analysis
This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict U.S. home prices based on factors like mortgage rates, unemployment, CPI, GDP, and housing starts. The data is sourced from FRED, and the model's performance is evaluated using R2 score and MSE. A scatter plot shows actual vs. predicted home prices.
